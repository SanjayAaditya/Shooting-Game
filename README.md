# Shooting-Game
The premise of the game is shoot and destroy the blue square before it destroys you. The is basic in functionality but features some interesting mechanics. 
Notable Systems:
  1) User has a cooldown mechanic and needs to wait until they can fire again. there will be a red circle to indicate whether a bullet is available or not.
  2) The cooldown for the user reduces over time and the duration or rate at which it decreases can be modified.
  3) The enemy fires one projectile per second at the beginning and the fire rate of the enemy increases over time at a steady rate. The max that the enemy can fire at a time is 7. these parameters can also be modified.
  4) The movement of the enemy is dependent on the user and it constantly tries to move away from the user. The enemy also constantly vibrates, which acts as both a rudimentary dodging mechanic and prediction mechanic.
  5) The shooting mechanism works on the basis of locating where the opponent is placed and launching a projectile towards that coordinate. The aforementioned vibration of the enemy makes it hard to shoot it accurately and since the the enemy moves constantly the projectiles fired from the enemy is also varied and is not always accurate.
  6) When the health of the enemy drops below 40%. The enemy starts teleporting at regular time intervals. The duration between the intervals and the health threshold to initiate this mechanism can also be modified.
  7) The score system is basic and doesn't add much to the game. The initial idea was to create a high score mechanic instead of a health bar mechanism. Can be incorporated if need be.
